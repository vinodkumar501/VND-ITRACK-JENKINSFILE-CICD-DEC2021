WHAT IS CI?
CI is a process where team members continuouslu integrate the work continuously in a shared repo

best achieved using some scm tools like GIT

can be daily or as needed every integration or checkin in the repo is validated by automated build or unit test or integration tests

Dev ---> test ----> deploy

CD?
continuous delivery

After CI process and running automation tests to ensure the build is ready for the release
ensure the build is deployable state

STAGING:
pre-prod or production ready replica env

Dev   --> test ---> staging --------Prod
------CD(delivery)------->
---CI------>
------------------------------------>(CD(deployment))

all these processes will automatically trigger called CI/CD pipeline.

CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT:
---------------------
CI and CD(delivery)

Automated deployment to prod
Every change that passed through automation tests is deployed to production

BUT this may not be used or practical in most organisatins , they donot have frequent or sooshort releases.
like FB Continuous frequent or short Deployment will use 
every deployment will pass through all stages it directly deploy to prod env ----> Deployment

what is CI?
place where multiple team members can integrate their work and stored in a shared repo and some testcases 

what is CD?
CI to staging like 
( after CD our code will be ready for productin ready code)

What is Deployment (CI)?
From CI to till prod

Devops?
Devops is software development approach which involves continuous development, build,integration, test,deploy and monitoring throughout the lifecycle.

Devops stages:

1.Version control : (SCM)
manage different version of source code

2.CI ( jenkins ): (continuous build )
building appn code continuously
Scenario:
Dev makes changes code CI server will pull the code and build the code ( not compile )
build not just compiling: build means validate, compile ,codereview ,build and unit(individual part) and integration(how different parts work together) testing 

3.Continuous Delivery:( cont testing)
Deploying build appn to test server and perform UAT ( staging area)

4.Cont Deploy:
deploy the tested appn code on to prod env

CI ----> SDLC

CI& CD
--> version control --> build(compile) --> unittest --> Deploy( stage area) -->auto test ( sanity test)--> Deploy to prod --> prod feedback

unit test:
breack complete s/w into small chunks

Integration test:
all these individual tested parts will check working proper or eachother or not

Pipeline:
logical or series of steps how sdlc will occur.

CICD: code will deliver shorter time to market

mvn install:
install all dependencies required to compile the appn
once all done then docker will deploy, once appn will process all tests successfully then use docker deploy it.
